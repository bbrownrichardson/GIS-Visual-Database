/********* Jr. I.S. FINAL VERSION ********/


Abstract:

Geographic Information Systems, GIS, is a system that interprets and presents geographic related data visually. The data GIS uses is spatial data which is information that identifies physical and non-physical features of a particular space \cite{Martindale}. For the scope of this project, the development of a 2D and 3D visual GIS database with a User Interface is a realistic goal. This software, referred to as VBASE, allows users to upload .shp, and .dbf files to a SQLite database while also being able to visualize such data both two and three-dimensionally. The premise of this paper is to provide in-depth explanation of the structure and software development process of VBASE. VBASE is a tool that allows users both with or without extensive knowledge of GIS to visualize such data.
