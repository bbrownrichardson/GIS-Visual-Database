# GIS-Visual-Database
/********* IN PROGRESS ********/


Abstract:

For the scope of this project, the development of a visual GIS database with a User Interface is a realistic goal. This software will allow users to essentially upload .shp, and .dbf files to a database while also being able to visualize such data in 2D and 3D (VR for future development). 


Language: Python

Frameworks: KIVY, sqlite


NOTE: Anyone interested in said software will have to wait for later stages of development to view the source code. Software in early stages of development will be placed in encrypt zip as I am far too cheap to purchase private repositories, but if anyone manages to crack said zips I'll be more impressed with your ability to do so than upset that the software was seen by others. Heck if you manage to open the zip do a pull request so we can chat haha.
